{"name":"Quantitative Economics with Python","tagline":"John Stachurski and Thomas J. Sargent","body":"**Quantitative Economics with Python** is an on-line course on quantitative economic modeling, authored by [John Stachurski](http://johnstachurski.net) and [Thomas J. Sargent](https://files.nyu.edu/ts43/public/).\r\n\r\nThe course consists of\r\n\r\n1. A [series of lectures](http://quant-econ.net)\r\n1. A [code repository](https://github.com/jstac/quant-econ) containing Python programs described in the lectures\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n\r\nWe recommend you start by visiting the [lecture series main\r\npage](http://quant-econ.net), which provides detailed information on getting\r\nstarting with Python and working with [the code repository](https://github.com/jstac/quant-econ).  \r\n\r\n#### About Git\r\n\r\nThis page is a front end to the code repository, which is stored on\r\n[Github](http://github.com). The primary function of Github is to host open\r\nsource code repositories in a manner that facilitates sharing and\r\ncollaboration.  Note that you can always download a copy of the repository \r\nby clicking the '.zip' (or '.tar.gz') button above.  However it's advisable that\r\nyou read the [lecture series](http://quant-econ.net) first, where all the programs are explained.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to learn a bit more about Git and Github, you'll\r\nfind it's an excellent investment. A good place to start is the [Github help\r\npage](https://help.github.com/).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
